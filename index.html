  <h4> Favorite Websites </h4>
  <p> I spend a lot of my time on Twitter. Many artists, comedians, and celebrities I enjoy share things about thier lives, music, and new projects. Many of them make me laugh and it can be a nice escape. You are also able to speak directly to them, and sometimes they'll answer. <br> For example, my favorite artist that I mentioned above, Phoebe Bridgers, has a great twitter presence. She makes me laugh while keeping me up to date with her current projects and endeavors. Click <a href="https://twitter.com/phoebe_bridgers" target="_blank"> here </a> to visit her twitter page!</p>
