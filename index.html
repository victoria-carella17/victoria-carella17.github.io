  <h4> Favorite Song </h4>
  <p> It's always changing, but right now anything by Phoebe Bridgers is at the top of my list, as well as Taylor Swift's new album Folklore. </p>

  <h4> Favorite TV Show </h4>
  <p> Comedies are always my go-to, and Parks & Recreation is one that I will always reach for if I need something to watch. </p>

  <h4> Favorite Websites </h4>
  <p> I spend a lot of my time on Twitter. Many artists, comedians, and celebrities I enjoy share things about thier lives, music, and new projects. Many of them make me laugh and it can be a nice escape. You are also able to speak directly to them, and sometimes they'll answer. <br> For example, my favorite artist that I mentioned above, Phoebe Bridgers, has a great twitter presence. She makes me laugh while keeping me up to date with her current projects and endeavors. Click <a href="https://twitter.com/phoebe_bridgers" target="_blank"> here </a> to visit her twitter page!</p>
